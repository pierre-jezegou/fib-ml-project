\section*{Introduction \& Context}
Understanding how many passengers use train stations and what features they have is important for improving transportation services. We're using machine learning to analyze train station data and predict passenger traffic.

To start, we're gathering data from reliable sources like the SNCF and INSEE websites to create a detailed dataset with lots of information about cities and train stations.

Next, we're cleaning up the data to fix errors and make sure it's good for analysis. Then, we'll use different machine learning models to try and figure out the best way to predict passenger traffic and understand what factors make some stations busier than others.

Overall, this project focuses on using advanced computer techniques to optimize transportation services by accurately predicting passenger traffic and understanding station dynamics.
